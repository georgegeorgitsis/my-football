## Getting Started

### Introduction
My Football is a command line script that quickly finds the best team out of thousands of random players, for a specific formation. 

The application was built using `python 3.6`, `mongoDB 4.0` and `docker-compose` 

### Installation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:georgegeorgitsis/sipcurious.git
$ go build -o sipcurious github.com/sotoz/sipcurious/cmd/sipcurious
```
